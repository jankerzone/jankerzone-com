# About Me

Hi, I’m the person behind **Jankerzone** — a small personal corner of the internet where I build, write, and experiment with ideas that blend code, creativity, and curiosity.

I’ve always been fascinated by how technology can simplify everyday life. Whether it’s through small web tools, automation scripts, or design experiments, this site serves as my public sandbox for learning and sharing what I build along the way.

Here, you’ll find:
- Notes about projects I’m exploring or lessons I’ve learned.
- Mini apps I built for fun (or out of frustration).
- Occasional reflections on software, AI, and personal productivity.

Everything here is handcrafted, evolving, and sometimes imperfect — just like the process of building things itself.

If any of these projects help you, inspire you, or make you think a little differently, that’s already a win in my book.
