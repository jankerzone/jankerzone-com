This is my personal corner of the internet — rebuilt, refined, and ready.

Built with **VitePress** and deployed on **Cloudflare Pages**, this site delivers speed, simplicity, and substance. No fluff. Just content that matters.

## ✨ Features

- **Notes** — Raw thoughts, technical learnings, and reflections  
- **Mini Apps & Tools** — Lightweight utilities and experiments  
- **Blazing Performance** — Static site + global CDN = instant loads  
- **Zero Maintenance** — Automatic deploys on every push  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **VitePress** (v1.6.4) — For the speed, the DX, and the simplicity  
- **Cloudflare Pages** — For automatic builds, global edge caching, and free SSL  
- **Markdown-first** — Content as code, version-controlled and future-proof
